# Retina Caffeine

I created some retina assets for the popular Mac App [Caffeine](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/caffeine/id411246225?mt=12). You can read more about it [here](http://blog.bkenny.com/brewing-retina-caffeine)

## Introduction

Since I got my Retina MBP, Caffeine is the only application on my menubar that doesn’t have a retina ready icon. I’ve emailed the guys that develop the app to no avail. To remedy this, I built some retina graphics of my own.

## Installation

Just download these files and place them in:

```
/Applications/Caffeine.app/Contents/Resources
```
